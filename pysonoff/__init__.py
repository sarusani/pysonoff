pysonoff
This module provides a way to interface with Sonoff smart home devices,
such as smart switches (e.g. Sonoff Basic), plugs (e.g. Sonoff S20),
and wall switches (e.g. Sonoff Touch), when these devices are in LAN Mode.

LAN Mode is a feature introduced by manufacturer Itead, to allow operation
locally when their servers are unavailable.
Further details can be found here:
https://help.ewelink.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360007134171-LAN-Mode-Tutorial

Since mid 2018, the firmware Itead have shipped with most Sonoff devices
has provided this feature, allowing devices to be controlled directly
on the local network using a WebSocket connection on port 8081.

The feature is designed to only be used when there is no connection
to the Itead cloud servers, (e.g. if your internet connection is down,
or their servers are down).
As such, it is only enabled when the device is connected to your WiFi
network, but *unable to reach the Itead servers*.
Most users will only be able to make use of this mode by deliberately
blocking internet access to their Sonoff devices.

All common, shared functionality is available through `SonoffDevice` class:

    x = SonoffSwitch("192.168.1.50")

Upon instantiating the SonoffSwitch class, a connection is
initiated and device state is populated, but no further action is taken.

For most use cases, you'll want to make use of the `callback_after_update`
parameter to send a command to the device after a connection has been
initialised, for example:

    async def state_callback(device):
        if device.basic_info is not None:
            print("ON" if device.is_on else "OFF")
            device.shutdown_event_loop()

    SonoffSwitch(
        host="192.168.1.50",
        callback_after_update=state_callback
    )

Module-specific errors are raised as Exceptions and are expected
to be handled by the user of the library.
